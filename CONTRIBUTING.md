In this project, we have to make unique and animated components.

You can use bootstrap components, but don't use them as it is , add different styles and animations if you can.

## Steps to follow while working on the page :

- Create a new folder with the name of your component and add the html,css,js files in that folder (Don't add your component code to the index.html)
- Link the html file of your component to the link on the card created at index.html file.
- Create new cards each new component you make.
